# Community Feed Application

This is a community feed application built using **Flutter**, allowing users to authenticate, create posts, react to posts, comment, reply to comments, and more. The app dynamically fetches posts from a provided API and displays them in a scrollable feed.

## Features

    - Secure login and logout functionality to clear user sessions.
- **Default Credentials (for testing):**
    - **Email**: `stu@test.io`
    - **Password**: `123456`
- **Community Feeds**
    - Fetch and display community posts.
    - Add/Update reactions to posts.
    - Post comments with replies.
    - real-time updates, ensuring that newly created posts, reactions, and comments are displayed immediately without requiring the user to refresh the page.
- **Post Integration**
    - Create, manage, and interact with posts.
- **Interactive UI**
    - Multiple custom icons for enhanced visual consistency.
    - Responsive design built with Flutter.
- **State Management**
    - Efficient and reactive state management powered by GetX.
