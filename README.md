    - Post comments with replies.
    - real-time updates, ensuring that newly created posts, reactions, and comments are displayed immediately without requiring the user to refresh the page.
- **Post Integration**
    - Create, manage, and interact with posts.
- **Interactive UI**
    - Multiple custom icons for enhanced visual consistency.
