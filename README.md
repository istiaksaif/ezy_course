# ezy_course
 EzyCourse is a Flutter-based community feed application that dynamically fetches posts, supports user authentication, and offers interactive features like posting, commenting, and reacting in real-time. Despite the name suggesting course management, this project focuses on delivering a modern social feed experience with a clean, responsive UI.
